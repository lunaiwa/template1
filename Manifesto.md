Agile Manifesto:
Through our own experience and that of others, we are learning more effective ways to create software. We've developed a sense of value for this job, and strive to have:

Interaction and collaboration with each other
High-quality, functional code to ensure our best product
Clear communication of group deadlines to stay on top of things
Our individual interests drive what tasks we want to complete 
Not settling for the bare minimum, but constantly improving our product to the best of our ability 
Everyone's best interest!
